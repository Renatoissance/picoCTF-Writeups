# Challenge: Super SSH
**Category:** General Skills | **Difficulty:** Easy | **Author:** Jeffery John

## 📝 Challenge Description
*"Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important. Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 56090 to get the flag?"*

> **Note:** This challenge uses **dynamic instances**. Each user is assigned a unique SSH connection string and a custom password for the initial login.

## 🔍 Analysis

### The SSH Protocol
To solve this, I connected to a remote host using the parameters provided in my specific instance:
* **Username:** `ctf-player`
* **Host:** `titan.picoctf.net`
* **Port:** `56090` (specified via the `-p` flag)
* **Password:** `1ad5be0d`

### Execution in a Virtual Environment
I performed the connection within a local **Ubuntu 22.04 environment running in VirtualBox**. Using a native terminal is essential for practicing real-world CLI skills.

**The Command:**
`ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 56090`

1.  **Handshake:** The server presented an ED25519 key fingerprint. I accepted it by typing `yes` to establish authenticity.
2.  **Authentication:** I entered the instance-specific password when prompted.
3.  **Flag Retrieval:** Upon login, the server displayed the flag and automatically closed the session.
